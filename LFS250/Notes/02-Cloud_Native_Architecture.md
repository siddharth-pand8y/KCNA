  - To meaure performance & reliability, SRE uses three main metrics
    
    - SLO - Service Level Objective - Specify a target level for the reliability of your service
    
    - SLI - Service Level Indicators - A carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided
    
    - SLA - Service Level Agreement - An explicit or implicit contract with your users that include consequences of meeting(or missing) the SLO they contain
    
    SRE may also define an error budget. An error budged defines the amount (or time) of errors your application can have, before actions are taken like stopping deployments to production
